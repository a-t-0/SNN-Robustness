# SNN-Brain-Adaptation-Inspired-Radiation-Robustness
Applies brain inspired adaptation mechanisms to increase the radiation robustness of spiking neural networks.

## Note
This code is currently still integrated in [this networkx LIF-neuron simulator](https://github.com/a-t-0/networkx-to-lava-nc), which is being refactored. After refactoring, the adaptation mechanisms will be moved into this separate repository.
